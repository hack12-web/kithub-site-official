    "about_historique_msg": "The Burundian population is extremely young, which must have been a huge asset for sustainable development. Indeed, half of the population is under the age of 17; 2/3 of Burundians are under 25 years old. On the other hand, we observe an unemployment rate, mostly among young people who are constantly growing, and young people in constant lack of opportunities to showcase their talents. We agree with John Irons, CEO of the Rockefeller Foundation and member of the S4YE Board of Trustees who said, “Youth unemployment is a growing global problem. When young workers are unable to connect with the labor market, this has profound repercussions on their ability to fully participate in the economy and threatens their economic and social future.” Responding to the call of the Government and the population in order to respond unmet critical needs, youth employability and job creation in Burundi, as well as strengthening love of country and neighbor, Mr. Chris Clément Igiraneza and Mrs. Amney Mzige Saleh with enthusiasm and will have initiated and created a network of support and expertise that will contribute to sustainable development in Burundi, in order to create a more inclusive community where everyone deserves an opportunity to live their full potential and in pure freedom. Thus, we must act now and act together if we are to realize the immense possibilities offered to us by these many young Burundians today. It is in this spirit that KIT Hub (Knowledge and Impact Trade Hub) was born to invest in Burundian youth and contribute to a Burundi that prospers through sustainable and inclusive development. KIT HUB is a social platform and community movement, a pan-African commitment to the democratization of knowledge and opportunities in Burundi, and social impact in order to make Burundian youth more educated, qualified and prosperous. We educate, inspire and support the Burundian population through several programs with a particular focus on young people with innovative ideas, and whose activities focus on inclusive and entrepreneurial digital transformation. KIT HUB is based on the spirit of UBUNTU and UJIMAA (responsibility and collective work) for the employability of Burundian youth, the reinvention of the local workforce and the creation of employment. KIT Hub puts youth at the center of the achievement of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), this is how all initiatives are driven by an awareness by young people themselves such as pooling, networking, UBUNTU and UJIMAA are the keys to innovation and job creation to ensure sustainable development in Burundi. In order, KIT Hub wants to be: An essential incubator for the Burundian population and Burundi who prosper: Leadership, Digital, Innovation, Entrepreneurship, Humanitarian and philanthropy. A bearer of hope for all the young people who benefit from its many programs, a guardian angel for all the women and children supported through various humanitarian programs.",
